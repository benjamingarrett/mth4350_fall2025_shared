1. Install the Quick Emulator (QEMU)

On my Ubuntu machine, I did the following (your specific steps may vary):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-system-misc qemu-user

When I check the version that's installed via:

qemu-system-riscv32 --version

I get the message:

QEMU emulator version 6.2.0 (Debian 1:6.2+dfsg-2ubuntu6.27)

Then I did:

sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf

  add t2, t0, t1   # t2 = t0 + t1
  li a7, 93        # ecall number for exit
  li a0, 0         # exit code 0

I assemble the file into an object file:

When I look at the object file using 

Second, I created a file containing RISC-V 32-bit assembly language, called example.s
